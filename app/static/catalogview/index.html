But it may have an even larger impact by serving as a new general-purpose “method of invention” that can reshape the nature of the innovation process and the organization of R&amp;D. We distinguish between automation-oriented applications such as robotics and the potential for recent developments in “deep learning” to serve as a general-purpose method of invention, finding strong evidence of a “shift” in the importance of application-oriented learning research since 2009. We suggest that this is likely to lead to a significant substitution away from more routinized labor-intensive research towards research that takes advantage of the interplay between passively generated large datasets and enhanced prediction algorithms. At the same time, the potential commercial rewards from mastering this mode of research are likely to usher in a period of racing, driven by powerful incentives for individual companies to acquire and control critical large datasets and application-specific algorithms. We suggest that policies which encourage transparency and sharing of core datasets across both public and private actors may be critical tools for stimulating research productivity and innovation-oriented competition going forward.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Iain M.

These innovations have the potential to directly influence both the production and the characteristics of a wide range of products and services, with important implications for productivity, employment, and competition. But, as important as these effects are likely to be, artificial intelligence also has the potential to change the innovation process itself, with consequences that may be equally profound, and which may, over time, come to dominate the direct effect.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Consider the case of Atomwise, a startup firm which is developing novel technology for identifying potential drug candidates (and insecticides) by using neural networks to predict the bioactivity of candidate molecules.  The company reports that its deep convolutional neural networks “far surpass” the performance of conventional “docking” algorithms.  After appropriate training on vast quantities of data, the company’s AtomNet product is described as being able to “recognize” foundational building blocks of organic chemistry, and is capable of generating highly accurate predictions of the outcomes of real-world physical experiments (Wallach et al., 2015).  Such breakthroughs hold out the prospect of substantial improvements in the productivity of early stage drug screening.  Of course, Atomwise’s technology (and that of other companies leveraging artificial intelligence to advance drug discovery or medical diagnosis) is still at an early stage:  though their initial results seem to be promising, no new drugs have actually come  to market using these new approaches. But whether or not Atomwise delivers fully on its promise, its technology is representative of the ongoing attempt to develop a new innovation “playbook”, one that leverages large datasets and learning algorithms to engage in precise prediction of biological phenomena in order to guide design effective interventions. Atomwise, for example, is now deploying this approach to the discovery and development of new pesticides and agents for controlling crop diseases.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Atomwise’s example illustrates two of the ways in which advances in artificial intelligence have the potential to impact innovation. First, though the origins of artificial intelligence are broadly in the field of computer science, and its early commercial applications have been in relatively narrow domains such as robotics, the learning algorithms that are now being developed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">suggest that artificial intelligence may ultimately have applications across a very wide range. From the perspective of the economics of innovation (among others, Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995)), there is an important distinction between the problem of providing innovation incentives to develop technologies with a relatively narrow domain of application, such robots purpose- built for narrow tasks, versus technologies with a wide—advocates might say almost limitless— domain of application, as may be true of the advances in neural networks and machine learning often referred to as “deep learning.” As such, a first question to be asked is the degree to which developments in artificial intelligence are not simply examples of new technologies, but rather may be the kinds of “general purpose technologies” (hereafter GPTs) that have historically been such influential drivers of long-term technological progress.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Second, while some applications of artificial intelligence will surely constitute lower-cost or higher-quality inputs into many existing production processes (spurring concerns about the potential for large job displacements), others, such as deep learning, hold out the prospect of not only productivity gains across a wide variety of sectors but also changes in the very nature of the innovation process within those domains. As articulated famously by Griliches (1957), by enabling innovation across many applications, the “invention of a method of invention” has the potential to have much larger economic impact than development of any single new product.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Here we argue that recent advances in machine learning and neural networks, through their ability to improve both the performance of end use technologies and the nature of the innovation process, are likely to have a particularly large impact on innovation and growth. Thus the incentives and obstacles that may shape the development and diffusion of these technologies are an important topic for economic research, and building an understanding of the conditions under which different potential innovators are able to gain access to these tools and to use them in a pro-competitive way is a central concern for policy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This essay begins to unpack the potential impact of advances in artificial intelligence on innovation, and to identify the role that policy and institutions might play in providing effective incentives for innovation, diffusion, and competition in this area. We begin in Section II by highlighting the distinctive economics of research tools, of which deep learning applied to R&amp;D problems is such an intriguing example. We focus on the interplay between the degree of generality of application of a new research tool and the role of research tools not simply in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">enhancing the efficiency of research activity but in creating a new “playbook” for innovation itself.  We then turn in Section III to briefly contrasting three key technological trajectories within AI—robotics, symbolic systems, and deep learning.  We propose that these often conflated fields will likely play very different roles in the future of innovation and technical change.  Work in symbolic systems appears to have stalled and is likely to have relatively little impact going forwards. And while developments in robotics have the potential to further displace human labor in the production of many goods and services, innovation in robotics technologies per se has relatively low potential to change the nature of innovation itself. By contrast, deep learning seems to be an area of research that is highly general-purpose and that has the potential to change the innovation process itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">We explore whether this might indeed be the case through an examination of some quantitative empirical evidence on the evolution of different areas artificial intelligence in terms of scientific and technical outputs of AI researchers as measured (imperfectly) by the publication of papers and patents from 1990 through 2015. In particular, we develop what we believe is the first systematic database that captures the corpus of scientific paper and patenting activity in artificial intelligence, broadly defined, and divides these outputs into those associated with robotics, symbolic systems, and deep learning. Though preliminary in nature (and inherently imperfect given that key elements of research activity in artificial intelligence may not be observable using these traditional innovation metrics), we find striking evidence for a rapid and meaningful shift in the application orientation of learning-oriented publications, particularly after 2009. The timing of this shift is informative, since it accords with qualitative evidence about the surprisingly strong performance of so-called “deep learning” multi-layered neural networks in a range of tasks including computer vision and other prediction tasks. Supplementary evidence (not reported here) based on the citation patterns to authors such as Geoffrey Hinton who are leading figures in deep learning suggests a striking acceleration of work in just the last few years that builds on a small number of algorithmic breakthroughs related to multi-layered neural networks.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Though not a central aspect of the analysis for this paper, we further find that, whereas research on learning-oriented algorithms has had a slow and steady upward swing outside of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">United States, US researchers have had a less sustained commitment to learning-oriented research prior to 2009, and have been in a “catch up” mode ever since.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Finally, we begin to explore some of the organizational, institutional and policy consequences of our analysis.  We see machine learning as the “invention of a method of invention” whose application depends, in each case, on having access not just to the underlying algorithms but also to large, granular datasets on physical and social behavior.  Developments in neural networks and machine learning thus raise the question of, even if the underlying scientific approaches (i.e., the basic multi-layered neural networks algorithms) are open, prospects for continued progress in this field—and commercial applications thereof—are likely to be significantly impacted by terms of access to complementary data.  Specifically, if there are increasing returns to scale or scope in data acquisition (there is more learning to be had from the “larger” dataset), it is possible that early or aggressive entrants into a particular application area may be able to create a substantial and long-lasting competitive advantage over potential rivals merely through the control over data rather than through formal intellectual property or demand- side network effects.  Strong incentives to maintain data privately has the additional potential downside that data is not being shared across researchers, thus reducing the ability of all researchers to access an even larger set of data that would arise from public aggregation.  As the competitive advantage of incumbents is reinforced, the power of new entrants to drive technological change may be weakened.  Though this is an important possibility, it is also the case that, at least so far, there seems to be a significant amount of entry and experimentation across most key application sectors.</p>
